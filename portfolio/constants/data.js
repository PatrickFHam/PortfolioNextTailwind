        `I count my varied background as an asset to become a serious software developer.`,
        `Growing up, I've always had parallel tracks: computers and music.  In the same day, I'd build a simple little BASIC (the language) program, and score an original composition.  In the same season, I'd take a Visual Basic course while preparing for a classical piano recital.`,
        `Musicians are puzzle solvers.  Composers and Arrangers absolutely are creative, but "the ideal" is always restricted by "the practical"... solve the puzzle.  Volunteer-team building and scheduling is NOTHING but puzzle-solving.`,
        `While I'm leaving music behind as a vocation, it has developed me (pun-intended) into both "a creative" and a leader.  To write orchestrations, one must be focused for hours at a time.  To oversee all-volunteer teams, one must be organized AND pleasant to work-with.  My 17 years in the music and non-profit world has made me more useful in tech.`,
